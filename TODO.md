# TO DO
* Remove commented out code and other functions that are never called.
* Clean up all comments in general.
* Double check that variable and function names match those used in the text.
* Make sure requirements.txt contains all the right dependencies and versions, so that everything would run correctly in a virtualenv.
* Add warnings for long scripts telling people how long they're going to take to run.
