A simple generative model (AKA "the neofunkatron") of the mouse mesoscale connectome
===

All code used to generate figures is in the directory final_figures. To run any piece of code, clone this repository, change directory to the repository root, and call python final_figures/figXXXX.py . Figures generated will be saved as pdf and png formats in the directory from which the command was invoked.

This project uses the "linear model" and brain region distance matrix used in Oh et al., (2014). Both are available in the supplementary information of http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v508/n7495/full/nature13186.html. When the code is run, these files will be downloaded to the current directory the first time they are needed. You must be connected to the internet for this to work.
