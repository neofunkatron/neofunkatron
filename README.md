A simple generative model of the mouse mesoscale connectome
===

All code used to generate figures is in the directory final_figures. If you run a script involving the connectivity atlas, the code will check for the .xlsx file containing the connectivity data (see below) and download it if it is not found.

## To Do
* Get rid of shite
* Rename things and clean up here and there
* Write code for reading from excel file

This project uses the "linear model" published in Oh et al., (2014), which is downloadable from http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v508/n7495/extref/nature13186-s4.xlsx .
